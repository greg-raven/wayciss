			Hello, I&rsquo;m Jared Taylor with American Renaissance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Listen up, white man. There are a lot of people out there who hate you, and they hate you because you are white. Some of them openly want you dead. Many of them preach tolerance and inclusion &mdash; just not for you. Whites are still the majority in this country, but we let this happen because most of us won&rsquo;t take our own side in an argument &mdash; and no one is going to take our side for us.
		</p>
		<p>
			This stuff goes back a long way: In 1967, novelist and essayist Susan Sontag wrote that &ldquo;the white race is the cancer of human history.&rdquo; That kind of hatred was a rarity then. Not any more.

			On Christmas Eve 2016, Drexel University professor George Cicciariello Maher tweeted, &ldquo;All I want for Christmas is white genocide.&rdquo; He also tweeted a follow-up message;
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When the whites were massacred during the Haitian revolution, that was a good thing indeed.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</blockquote>

			Sarah Jeong, who came to the United States as an immigrant from Korea, was appointed to the editorial board of <i>The New York Times</i> at age 30. Here are some of her tweets: &ldquo;White people have stopped breeding. You&rsquo;ll all go extinct soon. This was my plan all along.&rdquo; One of her tweets just said: &ldquo;CancelWhitePeople.&rdquo; &ldquo;White men are bullshit&rdquo; was another favorite. <i>The Times</i> knew about this when it hired her.

			Joseph Lowery is a civil rights hero who delivered the benediction at Barack Obama&rsquo;s inauguration in 2009. In 2012, he said that when he was younger he thought most white people were going to hell. Now that he&rsquo;s older and wiser, he thinks all white people are going to hell. Mr. Obama gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

			Tim Wise is a so-called anti-racist activist who has spoken at more than 1,000 college and high school campuses, where he charges $10,000 to give a talk.

			After a 2018 election in Mississippi in which a white Republican beat a black Democrat, he tweeted this:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Elections like tonight make it clear: Justice after 1865 would have been MS white property being burned to the ground &amp; all the landowners booted from their land &amp; all the wealth redistributed to former slaves, &amp; white folks crushed beyond repair. Sadly that didn&rsquo;t happen &hellip;&rdquo;
			</p>

			On Saturday Night Live, Jamie Foxx bragged about his role in his new movie, <i>Django Unchained:</i>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I kill all the white people in the movie. How great is that?&rdquo;
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		</figure>
		<p>
			After they watched the movie, <a href="https://www.amren.com/news/2013/01/moviegoer-seeing-django-reignited-my-desire-to-kill-white-people/">dozens of blacks tweeted that it made them want to go out and kill white people</a>.

			There is a museum in San Francisco called the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Last year, it exhibited an endless-loop video by a Hispanic man called <i><a href="https://www.amren.com/commentary/2019/08/why-dont-we-murder-more-white-people/">Why Don&rsquo;t We Murder More White People?</a></i>

			During the Senate hearings on Brett Kavanaugh&rsquo;s appointment to the supreme court, <a href="https://www.amren.com/news/2018/10/georgetown-professor-says-white-gop-senators-deserve-miserable-deaths-after-kavanaugh-hearing/">Georgetown Professor Christine Fair</a> attacked all white men who defended Mr. Kavanaugh against charges of sexual assault. She said,
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</blockquote>

			Nicholas Powers is an associate professor of literature at State University of New York. Last year, he wrote an essay called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amren.com/news/2019/06/seeing-poor-white-people-makes-me-happy/">Seeing Poor White People Makes Me Happy</a>.&rdquo; He wrote about what he thinks when he sees a white beggar: &ldquo;Should I kick him in the face? Hard? He went on:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When a white person begs &hellip; I feel better &hellip; I feel happy. It feels like Afro-Futurism after America falls.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			Johnny Eric Williams is a tenured professor at Trinity College in Connecticut. He ended a tirade against whiteness and white supremacy with the words:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Let them fucking die.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<figure>
			<img src="/_assets/img/Johnny-Eric-Williams.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Johnny Eric Williams" class="img-thumbnail">
		</figure>
		<p>
			He also called whites &ldquo;inhuman assholes.&rdquo; More recently he tweeted: <a href="https://www.courant.com/politics/hc-pol-trinity-professor-tweets-20190423-ivp7byahsfdm7f2uc3crfxp2ra-story.html">&ldquo;whiteness is terrorism,&rdquo;</a> adding that &ldquo;All self-identified white people (no exceptions) are invested in and collude with systemic white racism/white supremacy.&rdquo;
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a mainstream idea. Being color-blind, trying to rise above race isn&rsquo;t enough. As the Washington Post warns us, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/05/white-parents-teach-their-children-be-colorblind-heres-why-thats-bad-everyone/">&ldquo;White parents teach their children to be colorblind. Here&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s bad for everyone.&rdquo;</a> The author says, &ldquo;whiteness exists as a system of power.&rdquo; If you and your children are not constantly fighting that system, you&rsquo;re perpetuating white supremacy.

		<p>
			In other words, white people are a problem that has to be solved.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tim Wise, whom we met earlier, has the solution. As he wrote in a post he later took down,
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We just have to be patient, and wait for your hearts to stop beating. Your nation, as you knew it is ending permanently. And the sound of your demise is beautiful.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			That&rsquo;s how many leftists think. Dowell Myers is a demographer at the University of Southern California.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="/_assets/img/Dowell-Myers.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dowell Myers" class="img-thumbnail">
		</figure>
		<p>
			He wrote in <i>The New York Times</i> about conversations with &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; about population changes that will make whites a minority: &ldquo;It was conquest, our day has come,&rdquo; he said of their reaction. &ldquo;They wanted to overpower them &mdash; that means overpower white people &mdash; with numbers. It was demographic destiny.&rdquo;
		</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<p>
			They want us gone, and they hate it that we ever came. Columbus, of course, started the cancer, and that&rsquo;s why his statues are taking a beating. Here&rsquo;s one in Central Park in New York. Note the blood on his hands.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="/_assets/img/Columbus-1.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="desecrated Columbus statue" class="img-thumbnail">
		</figure>
		<p>
			This is Columbus Park in Buffalo, New York.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="/_assets/img/Columbus-2.jpg" width="410" height="540" alt="vandalized Columbus statue" class="img-thumbnail">

		<p>
			Here is the explorer in Detroit with a tomahawk in his head.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="/_assets/img/Columbus-3.jpg" width="1024" height="613" alt="damaged Columbus statue" class="img-thumbnail">
		</figure>
		<p>
			The one in Bridgeport, Connecticut says &ldquo;Kill the colonizer.&rdquo; Today, of course, you&rsquo;re the colonizer.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="/_assets/img/Columbus-4.jpg" width="384" height="371" alt="defaced Columbus statue" class="img-thumbnail">
		</figure>
		<p>
			But if we can&rsquo;t be exterminated or driven off, so-called &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; have a different solution: miscegenation. Big names like Norman Podhoretz, Morton Kondracke, Nicholas Kristof, Douglas Besharov, Stephen and Abigail Thernstrom and John Miller of National Review all agree with Michael Barone, who wrote in US News and World Report,
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My great wish is that 50 years from now we will be so mixed there will be no more racial categories.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			It looks like Google agrees. Here were the top results for a recent search for an image for &ldquo;white couple.&rdquo; In the middle row, you even see a white gay couple with an adopted black baby.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="/_assets/img/white-couple.jpg" width="1024" height="528" alt="so-called white couples" class="img-thumbnail">
		</figure>
		<p>
			And, of course, it&rsquo;s well known that if you search Google for &ldquo;American Inventors&rdquo; you get almost nothing but black people.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="/_assets/img/American-inventors.jpg" width="1024" height="991" alt="so-called American inventors" class="img-thumbnail">
		</figure>
		<p>
			Is something going on here? Yes, there is something going on. And we are the only people who can put a stop to it. Sometimes little things can be effective. The Drexel prof who wanted white genocide for Christmas resigned after intense criticism. Trinity College, where the black prof called us &ldquo;inhuman assholes&rdquo; lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations, and dozens of students withdrew.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are not alone. There are plenty of wide-awake whites, but too many are afraid. If you speak up, you might be surprised by the number of people who join you. Sometimes just one white man with a spine can make all the difference.
		</p>
		<p>
			And there are groups &mdash; like mine, American Renaissance &mdash; that exist for no other purpose than to fight for the legitimate interests of white people. Find a group and support it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Remember: No one else is going to save us from this hatred and its consequences. Silence is capitulation. Do something positive. Do it today.
